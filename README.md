Ideas, resources, and discussions.
My name is Lyles, techincally it is my last name but it is what everyone calls me. I work at Steak N' Shake currently when I'm typing this and I used to dye my hair a lot of colors. My favorite color I had was orange, and I had it that color for the longest out of any other color.
